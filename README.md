# Melanoma Classification using Transfer Learning

Classification of Skin lesions into 3 types of Skin diseases, including Melanoma, using Transfer Learning on the popular VGG16 Architecture. This project was introduced to me in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Skin Cancer Diagnosis Problem

Melanoma is the deadliest form of Skin Cancer. Melanoma is malignant, while Nevus and Seborrheic Keratosis are benign. Skin Cancer is diagnosed by a dermatologist, using visual inspection, that is looking at the skin lesion from naked eyes. This has been the traditional way to diagnose Skin Cancers upto now. But after the advancements in Deep Learning, research has shown that CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) can classify the same, with a performance that is better than the diagnosis made by the best of the dermatologists. This came as a surprise and a great promise in the field.
